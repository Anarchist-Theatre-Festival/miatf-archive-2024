    		<p><strong><em>Alexis. Una Tragedia Greca [Alexis. A Greek Tragedy]</em></strong><br>
Moteus<br>
<em>(Rome, Italy, in English)</em></p>

	<p>“How to transform indignation into action?” This simple and enormous question sent us on the tracks of Antigone: a backward glance, listening to her radiant stubbornness, in order to reflect on the present. We worked at recomposing the tragic events into an original play, using a script impregnated with the biographies and personal experiences of the actors involved. An itinerary begun in 2008 from which three contests emerged, performances intended as confrontations/dialogues between Antigone-Silvia Calderoni and three different actors: Benno Steinegger-Polynices, Vladimir Aleksic-Creon and Gabriella Rusticali-Tiresias, entitled “Let The Sunshine In”, “Too Late!” and “Iovadovia”.<br>
“Alexis” stands at the end of this journey though it presupposes the beginning: in August 2010 we went to Greece to retrace direct testimony of the killing, by a policeman, of fifteen year old Alexandros-Andreas Grigoropoulos (Alexis) which happened during our first study workshop for Antigone: a â€œPolynicesâ€ with a Sex Pistols T-shirt. . .â€</p>

	<p><strong>Motus</strong> was born in 1991 as an independent nomadic theatre company, in constant movement between countries, historical moments and disciplines. The founders Enrico Casagrande and Daniela NicolÃ², animated by the necessity to deal with themes, conflicts and wounds of the present time, blend art and civic engagement crossing imageries that have reactivated the visions of some amongst the most controversial â€œpoetsâ€ of contemporaneity.<br>
The group, who burst onto the scene in the Nineties with productions wielding great physical and emotional impact, has always anticipated and portrayed some of the harshest contradictions of the present day. It has experienced and created hyper-contemporary theatre trends, performing authors such as Camus, Beckett, DeLillo, Rilke or their beloved Pasolini, leading to Shakespeareâ€™s The Tempest, interpolated by AimÃ© CÃ©saire, which powerfully evoked the tragedy of migration and created instant communities around the world.</p>

	<p>“After 3990 years we have returned. We decided to return to being the matter and the water that we have been. Today we are eight. We do not know how many more have come back, walking, running, appearing or being born . . . we are here . . . just like you.”<br>

	<p><strong><span class="caps">JAM</span> Dance Company</strong> was born in 2010 out of the need to have a space for creation and dance for students. In the beginning, it was formed by outstanding students from the same school, creating works in small formats, participating in dance meetings and festivals. Over time, professional dancers and dance students were integrated, seeking a space to train and create. Now under the direction of Jennifer AlegrÃ­a, the company plays an active role in dance, performing continuously and creating new spaces for dance in everyday life.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Bloom</em></strong><br>
Molly Siboulet-Ryan <br>
<em>(MontrÃ©al, Dance theatre)</em></p>

	<p>“Bloom is a contradiction between softness and strength, calm and frustration, fall and persistence. Immersed in a cycle, from which she draws her power, she collapses to erect herself. Yet she has not yet surrendered to her inner freedom and fury. Bloom still resists. Inspired by the history of the creator’s maternal lineage, Bloom attempts to extract from the shadows lives tainted by secrecy, shame and oppression. From the exploration of characters and stories, small universes are born to offer to the spectator, small time capsules in which to get lost for an evening.”</p>

	<p><em>Molly Siboulet-Ryan</em> is an artist in motion, based in Montreal since 2018. Her research is part of a process of denunciation and intergenerational healing. Through her process, she attempts to heal her family traumas generated by the Catholic Church and patriarchal society in which women are systematically at fault.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Eviction? Dogâ€™s Blood! Nick Zynchuk &amp; Montrealâ€™s Red Plateau, 1933</em></strong> <br>
Norman Nawrocki<br>
<em>(Montreal, English)</em></p>

	<p>Based on a true story that made Montreal headlines in 1933. Nawrocki portrays Nick Zynchuk, an unemployed, Polish-Ukrainian worker caught in the middle of an eviction drama. During the Depression, mass unemployment hit Montreal hardest in poor neighbourhoods like â€˜The Plateau.â€™ Trendy today, but known then as â€˜The Red Plateauâ€™ because of its radical, immigrant, working class population, the area was rocked by evictions and organized, street-level resistance to them. As rampant speculation, gentrification and greed fuel todayâ€™s housing crisis with tenants being evicted en masse, Nawrockiâ€™s timely play (filmed during the pandemic lockdown) suggests one option: â€œstay and fight.â€ Filmed by Joyce Valbuena.</p>

	<p><strong>Norman Nawrocki</strong> is a Ukrainian-Polish-Canadian anarchist playwright, actor, author, musician &amp; â€˜sex advocateâ€™ who started performing poetry in the 1980s, &amp; then formed bands, cabaret troupes, &amp; theatre groups &amp; toured the world. His original plays address both historical &amp; contemporary issues of social justice.</p>

	<p>“We present an audiovisual documentary that features the performance of LA <span class="caps">CALLE</span> ES <span class="caps">LIBRE</span>, held in Santiago de Chile. This street dance performance presents a direct choreographic provocation in public and seeks to install the political and social theme of the “third gender”, its freedom of expression and their equality in society.<br>
The right to react and to have an opinion on issues of gender identity and the appreciation of <span class="caps">LGTBIQ</span>+ people is strengthened. This artistic action was performed in different pulic places during July 2017.”<br>

	<p><strong><em>MinistÃ¨re de la Nouvelle NormalitÃ© vs. Suncor, <span class="caps">RBC</span> and Garda</em></strong> <br>
MinistÃ¨re de la Nouvelle NormalitÃ© <br>
<em>(MontrÃ©al, in French)</em></p>

	<p>“The jury is you in this comedy play presented as a trial of three companies â€“ Suncor, <span class="caps">RBC</span> and Garda â€“ for the crime of ecocide. Through witnesses from the past, present and future, the Prosecutor and Defence Counsel make their cases and then let the audience decide. While the trial is a farce, all legal arguments are based on real facts and law. In the Prosecutorâ€™s case, the audience will be confronted with the true history of how companies hid the science behind global warming from the public. The audience will then hear arguments in the Defence Counselâ€™s case that are often made by companies to obfuscate the truth. The audience is asked to render a verdict, prompting a discussion of how society should deal with the actions of the fossil fuel industry.”</p>

	<p><strong>The MinistÃ¨re de la Nouvelle NormalitÃ©</strong> is a satirical group of Montreal climate activists that uses art and humour to make people aware of the climate crisis. The <span class="caps">MNN</span> acts as a para-governmental agency that takes action when other governments fail to act.<br>
Playwrights &amp; performers: Barbara Bedont, Elza Kephart &amp; Kelly McKinney, plus<br>
Lucile Siraut, Juliette Rigaul, Kai McCall, Sepideh Anvar, Bruce Mellett, Marguerite Kephart, Anne Marie Dâ€™Amour &amp; Anne-Marie de la Sablonniere.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Peter &amp; Emmaâ€™s CafÃ©, An Operetta</em></strong><br>
Against Again Theatre Troupe of Taiwan<br>
<em>(Taiwan, in Cantonese with English subtitles)</em></p>

	<p>“Peter &amp; Emma are stuck in Taipei during the <span class="caps">COVID</span> pandemic and want to do something worthy without wasting their time. They search for a place to start a bookshop/cafÃ© where people can gather, something typical for 1930s Berlin and Paris. In the operetta, friends drop by, including a farmer, a baker, a sex worker and an overseas student to meet up and share stories. The operetta is a situational/geopolitical idea of songs and stories written by Lenny Kwok from Hong Kong.<br>
It is a theatrical production with no director, no script, and no rehearsals as such.<br>
It does not entail a group of definite actors; it could be different at times.<br>
The actors in the filmed performance at the Witch House Taipei in 2021: <br>
Lenny kwok as Peter<br>
June zhu as Emma<br>
Brian Wong, the dead soldier<br>
Vivian Dai, the chef<br>
Unchi wong, the independent farmer<br>
Lala Lau, the sex-worker<br>
Guojia, the mainland student<br>
and, Zigang Lin, the whistle-blower poet.<br>
The program of songs included stories from people spanning more than a hundred years.”</p>

	<p><strong><em>The Conundrum of Revolution</em></strong><br>
<span class="caps">DAH</span> Teatar<br>
<em>(Belgrade, Serbia, in English)</em></p>

	<p>“The performance creates an alternative reality in which Rosa Luxembourg gets to meet revolutionaries and poets from across the world – four revolutionaries â€“ Rosa, the Red Army Factionâ€™s member Ulrike Meinnhof, Castroâ€™s comrade-in-arms Camilo Cienfuegos, and Leninâ€™s assassin Fanny Kaplan, as well as the poets Kharms and Mayakovsky, walk through time and speak to one another, and to us, â€œfrom the other side.â€ Their spirits still breathe down our backs. What are they saying to us today? What is justified in order to gain power and preserve the revolution? How far can the revolution go in preserving its own values?”</p>

	<p><strong><span class="caps">DAH</span> Theater</strong> is an independent, professional, contemporary theatre troupe and artistic collective that uses modern theatre techniques to create engaging art and initiate positive social change, both locally and globally. <span class="caps">DAH</span> Theatre uses methods of devised theatre, while its productions develop on the crossroads between theatre, dance, and visual arts. Starting with a problem or a theme, continuing through research and elaborate rehearsal process, <span class="caps">DAH</span> Theatre productions are the result of a long-term creative process. <span class="caps">DAH</span> Theatre develops highly artistic plays with the vision of nurturing a non-violent and tolerant society. â€œIn todayâ€™s world, we can oppose destruction and violence with the creation of meaning.â€</p>

	<p><span class="caps">DAH</span> Theater was founded by directors Dijana MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡ and Jadranka AnÄ‘eliÄ‡ in 1991, out of the need to experiment and research further in their theater work. <br>
The Center has organized and realized many events: specific workshops (Laban technique, Alexander technique, the legacy of Maga MagazinoviÄ‡, work with stilts, Butho, Suzuki technique, etc.), international festivals and meetings with important artists from all over the world (Odin Theater â€“ Denmark, Joshi Oida â€“ France / Japan, Shiro Daimon â€“ France / Japan, Sonia Kehler â€“ Germany, Jill Greenghalgh â€“ Great Britain, David Zinder â€“ Israel, Ron Jenkins â€“ <span class="caps">USA</span>, 7 Stages Theater â€“ <span class="caps">USA</span> , Bond Steet Theater â€“ <span class="caps">USA</span>, Anna Zubrzicky and Grzegorz Bral â€“ Poland, Stella Chiweshe â€“ Zimbabwe, Gennadi Bogdanov â€“ Russia, among others). In 2016, <span class="caps">DAH</span> Theater celebrated its 25th anniversary as the first book on <span class="caps">DAH</span> Theater was published â€“ <span class="caps">DAH</span> Theater â€“ A Sourcebook (Lexington Books, Iowa, <span class="caps">USA</span>).</p>
